One of the main costs in manual warehouse order picking is the travel time of the pickers between product locations. Some estimates go as far as 70% of picking time is lost to travel. It is therefore desirable to reduce picker travel time as to increase order throughput. However, in warehouses with a range of products and different customer orders it is not feasible to determine the absolute optimal configuration due to the high-dimensionality of the problem. Further complexity is added by the fact that companies continuously develop new or terminate old products as well as customer preferences change leading to different order patterns. To respond to these dynamics warehouses need to update their storage locations in order to maintain the reduction in picker travel time. 

We present a framework for the continuous optimization of product storage assignment. Based on a dynamic warehouse model that allows us to investigate different warehouse layouts and storage cell designs, we implement a genetic algorithm minimizing the overall picking time for a set of time varying order lists. Assuming a manual warehouse we evaluate new routes with respect to their likelihood of inducing errors to the manual picking process. Comparing different routing strategies we evaluate preferred solutions that balance the technical optimum storage assignment obtained from the genetic algorithm and the ease for workers to adjust to new routing schemes.
